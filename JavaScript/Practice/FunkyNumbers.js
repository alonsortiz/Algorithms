 * As you very well know, this year's funkiest numbers are so called triangular numbers 
 * (that is, integers that are representable as k(k+1) / 2, where k is some positive integer), 
 * and the coolest numbers are those that are representable as a sum of two triangular numbers.
 * 
 * A well-known hipster Andrew adores everything funky and cool but unfortunately, 
 * he isn't good at maths. Given number n, help him define whether this number can be represented 
 * by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!
